The aim of this report is to present the amount of hours spent by the different ages doing homework per week, based on a survey carried out among pupils.

Moreover, it will comment on the importance of homework and suggest ways to reduce the amount of homework.

The hours spent on homework

40% of the people aged 17-19 years use more than 12 hours of their time per week to do their homework.

Homework, for the younger ones, that's just 25%.

It also has to be said that a bit over 25% of the ones aged 17-19 and a little over 20% of the ones aged 14-16 work 8 to 12 hours per week at home for school.

It is a great way for students to revise the things they learn at school if they do some tasks at home.

If teachers revised things I topics with their students for like 10 minutes at the beginning of every lesson, they could reduce the amount of homework.

Based on the findings of the survey, it can be said that many students spend way too much time on homework.

If you are a teacher, just think about it sometimes, if the students really need another piece of work, that only stresses them out.
